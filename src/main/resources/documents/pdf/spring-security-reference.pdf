SPRING SECURITY REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

Chapter 1: Authentication Architecture

Spring Security provides comprehensive authentication and authorization support for Java applications. The framework supports various authentication mechanisms including form-based login, HTTP Basic authentication, and JWT token-based authentication.

Key Components:
- SecurityContext: Holds security information about the current user
- Authentication: Represents the user's authentication token  
- AuthenticationManager: Processes authentication requests
- UserDetailsService: Loads user-specific data
- PasswordEncoder: Encodes and validates passwords

Chapter 2: JWT Integration

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a compact way to securely transmit information between parties. When implementing JWT in Spring Security:

1. Configure JWT Authentication Filter
2. Implement JWT Token Provider
3. Create Custom User Details Service
4. Configure Security Filter Chain

Security Considerations:
- Use strong signing algorithms (HS512 or RS256)
- Implement proper token validation
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Handle token refresh securely
- Implement token blacklisting for logout

Chapter 3: Method Security

Spring Security supports method-level security through annotations:
- @PreAuthorize: Check permissions before method execution
- @PostAuthorize: Check permissions after method execution  
- @Secured: Simple role-based access control
- @RolesAllowed: JSR-250 security annotations

Best Practices:
- Use SpEL expressions for complex authorization logic
- Implement custom permission evaluators
- Cache security decisions when appropriate
- Design hierarchical role structures
